    "# Intructions for running the solution\n",
    "## Initial setup\n",
    "The solution depends on the following python packages:\n",
    "  - numpy\n",
    "  - pandas\n",
    "  - scikit-learn\n",
    "  - pydot\n",
    "  - openpyxl\n",
    "  - xlsxwriter\n",
    "You can either install them manually, or create a new Anaconda environment with all of them.\n",
    "### Anaconda setup\n",
    "1. Open Anaconda prompt in the directory of solution.\n",
    "2. Execute the following command, replace 'envName' with the environment name of your choice\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "conda env update -n envName -f deps.yaml\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Activate new environment\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "conda activate envName\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Run the scripts\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "python script.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the solution\n",
    "1. Run the train.py script first so that we can train our model and then save it in a model.sav file so that it can later be called in our deploy.py file and used to classify addresses.\n",
    "2. And then run the script `classifier.py` where it will be asked to enter a txt file name containing addresses that wants them to be classified. If you're using an  `Anaconda` installation, make sure that an environment containing the `Pandas` library is activated.\n",
    "4. The program will create a file `classified.xlsx` with nicely formatted classification results. Within the code, function `classify_addresses` classifies addresses and returns the updated `DataFrame`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Things to look out for\n",
    "If the script is run with the file `classified.xlsx` open, the program may fail."
