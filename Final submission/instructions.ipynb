    "# Intructions for running the solution\n",
    "## Initial setup\n",
    "The solution depends on the following python packages:\n",
    "  - numpy\n",
    "  - pandas\n",
    "  - scikit-learn\n",
    "  - pydot\n",
    "  - openpyxl\n",
    "  - xlsxwriter\n",
    "  - joblib\n",
    "  - seaborn\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either install them manually, or create a new Anaconda environment with all of them.\n",
    "### Anaconda setup\n",
    "1. Open Anaconda prompt in the directory of solution.\n",
    "2. Execute the following command, replace 'envName' with the environment name of your choice\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "conda env update -n envName -f deps.yaml\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Activate new environment\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "conda activate envName\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Run the scripts\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "python script.py\n",

    "- `train.py` - a script that trains the AI model using logistic regression and saves it into file `model.sav`\n",
    "- `prepare.py` - a script that parses `raw_data.xlsx` and creates a file `training_data.xlsx` with derived features. Not needed if only `train.py` is used\n",
    "- `train-logistic-regression.py` - trains a logistic regression model. Requires `prepare.py` to have been ran in advance. Saves the model into `model.sav`\n",
    "- `train-naive-bayes.py` - trains a naive bayes model. Requires `prepare.py` to have been ran in advance. Saves the model into `model.sav`\n",
    "- `train-random-forest.py` - trains a random forest model. Requires `prepare.py` to have been ran in advance. Saves the model into `model.sav`\n",

    "## Running the solution\n",
    "Using a default model:\n",
    "1. Run `train.py` to train a logistic regression model\n",
    "2. Run `deploy.py` to use the trained model to classify new addresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a custom model:\n",
    "1. Run `prepare.py` to generate derived training data\n",
    "2. Run any of `train-naive-bayes.py`, `train-random-forest.py` or `train-logistic-regression.py` to train a respective model\n",
